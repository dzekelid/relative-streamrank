  title: Uber Price Estimates
  description: The Price Estimates endpoint returns an estimated price range for each
    product offered at a given location. The price estimate is provided as a formatted
    string with the full price range and the localized currency symbol.<br><br>The
    response also includes low and high estimates, and the [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
    currency code for situations requiring currency conversion. When surge is active
    for a particular product, its surge_multiplier will be greater than 1, but the
    price estimate already factors in this multiplier.
